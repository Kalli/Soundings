# Soundings

A bookmarklet, in browser video installation, an invitation for you to willfully interrupt your web browsing. 

_Soundings_ by [Loren Britton](https://lorenbritton.com/) and [Romi Ron Morrison](https://elegantcollisions.com/) is the fourth and final online commission in the series â€˜Patterns in Resistance, curated by [Miriam Wistreich](http://miriamwistreich.net/) for [Kunsthalle Amsterdam](https://kunsthalleamsterdam.nl/all). 

Programming by [Karl Tryggvason](http://karltryggvason.com/)

## How does it work?

* For local development run `npm install` and `npm start`. Browse to http://localhost:8080/ to try it out.
* To create the final bookmarklet run `make all` (uses [Bookmarklet](https://github.com/mrcoles/bookmarklet) to create a bookmarklet from the Javascript code)
* The build output should live in `./bookmarklet/index.html`
